```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(here)

loans <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-11-26/loans.csv")
```

Taking a look at dataset and doing some cleaning
```{r cleaning}
loanz <- loans %>%
  mutate(year_qtr = (year + (quarter - 1)*.25))

loanz %>%
  distinct(agency_name)


```
