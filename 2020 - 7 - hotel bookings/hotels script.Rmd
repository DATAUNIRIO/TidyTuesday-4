## Possible options

1. World map with counts of hotels booked (potentially faceted by whether people have kids)
2. Rank chart of European countries over time (count of number booked; could add gghighlight by largest abs diff from first measurement to last measurement) ** I like this one so far
3. Some sort of MLM or mapped arima predicting number of bookings in top 10 destinations
4. Model predicting whether a booking was canceled or not. ** I also like this one

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)

hotels <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-02-11/hotels.csv')
```

```{r}
hotels %>%
  count(country, sort = TRUE)

wm <- map_data("world")
```
